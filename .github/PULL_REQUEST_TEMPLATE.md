<!--

Make sure to run `msbuild /t:pack` in the repository root when
you have any of the following changes that affect auto-generated files. Otherwise, the CI build will fail.

- Adding a new diagnostic analyzer or a code fix
- Adding or updating resource strings used by analyzers and code fixes
- Updating analyzer package versions in [Versions.props](../eng/Versions.props)

(Consider merging master into your branch before you run msbuild pack to reduce having merge conflicts)

If you're adding a new rule, Make sure to read the guidlines in: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/GuidelinesForNewRules.md.
Also, see https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/dotnet/dotnet-contribute-code-analysis#contribute-docs-for-caxxxx-rules for documentation guidelines.

## Steps to generate Packages

Please follow the below steps after publishing analyzer NuGet packages from this repo onto NuGet.org:

1. Create a new release OR Update an existing draft release:
   1. Draft: Either click [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/releases/new) to draft a new release OR update an [existing draft release](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/releases). For reference, you can look at any of the existing releases, say [v2.9.3](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/releases/edit/v2.9.3).
   2. Release notes: Follow the steps in the *Steps to generate Release Notes* below to generate Release notes and copy the generated notes to the description section of the new release.
   3. Publish: Mark the release as a pre-release if appropriate and click "Publish Release".
2. Repo changes:
   1. Checkout a new branch from latest sources of release branch.
   2. Update `VERSIONING.md`: Add a new row in the released version table.
   3. Update `.github\ISSUE_TEMPLATE\bug-report.md`: Update the package version in the example section to the latest released package version.
   4. Update `eng\Versions.props`:
      1. Bump up the `VersionPrefix`. If the new version prefix is greater then or equals the current `AnalyzerUtilitiesVersionPrefix`, then update `AnalyzerUtilitiesVersionPrefix` to `$(VersionPrefix)`.
      2. Reset `PreReleaseVersionLabel` to `beta1`.
      3. Update `DogfoodNetAnalyzersVersion` and/or `DogfoodAnalyzersVersion` to the latest released package version.
   5. Build the repo by invoking `eng\common\CIBuild.cmd` and fix/suppress any new CA diagnostics, as appropriate. This should also update the analyzer documentation files in the repo to use the new version prefix.
   6. Move all the entries from `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` to `AnalyzerReleases.Shipped.md` for various analyzer NuGet package projects under a new "Release" section in the shipped file.
   7. Create and submit a PR with the above changes.

## Steps to generate Release Notes

1. Checkout the sources for the release branch locally. This would normally be the main branch.
2. Build.
3. Ensure that nuget.exe is on path.
4. Generate notes: Switch to the output directory, say `artifacts\bin\ReleaseNotesUtil\Debug\netcoreapp3.1` and execute `GenDiffNotes.cmd` to generate release notes.  Example command line for v2.9.4 to v2.9.5: `GenDiffNotes.cmd C:\scratch nuget.org 2.9.4 2.9.5`.

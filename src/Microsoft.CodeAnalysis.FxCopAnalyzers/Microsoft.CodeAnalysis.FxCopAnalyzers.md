## [CA1000](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1000): Do not declare static members on generic types

When a static member of a generic type is called, the type argument must be specified for the type. When a generic instance member that does not support inference is called, the type argument must be specified for the member. In these two cases, the syntax for specifying the type argument is different and easily confused.

Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through the method, which is determined by the number and complexity of conditional branches. A low cyclomatic complexity generally indicates a method that is easy to understand, test, and maintain. The cyclomatic complexity is calculated from a control flow graph of the method and is given as follows: `cyclomatic complexity = the number of edges - the number of nodes + 1`, where a node represents a logic branch point and an edge represents a line between nodes.

Program volume is a measure of the difficulty of understanding of a symbol that is based on the number of operators and operands in the code. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of the type or method. A low maintainability index indicates that code is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate to redesign.

ValueTasks returned from member invocations are intended to be directly awaited.  Attempts to consume a ValueTask multiple times or to directly access one's result before it's known to be completed may result in an exception or corruption.

Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, inflict a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, or even execute arbitrary code upon it being deserialized. It’s frequently possible for malicious users to abuse these deserialization features when the application is deserializing untrusted data which is under their control. Specifically, invoke dangerous methods in the process of deserialization. Successful insecure deserialization attacks could allow an attacker to carry out attacks such as DoS attacks, authentication bypasses, and remote code execution.

## [CA5394](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca5394): Do not use insecure randomness

Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator may allow an attacker to predict what security-sensitive value will be generated. Use a cryptographically strong random number generator if an unpredictable value is required, or ensure that weak pseudo-random numbers aren't used in a security-sensitive manner.

## [CA5395](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca5395): Miss HttpVerb attribute for action methods

All the methods that create, edit, delete, or otherwise modify data do so in the [HttpPost] overload of the method, which needs to be protected with the anti forgery attribute from request forgery. Performing a GET operation should be a safe operation that has no side effects and doesn't modify your persisted data.

## [CA5396](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca5396): Set HttpOnly to true for HttpCookie

As a defense in depth measure, ensure security sensitive HTTP cookies are marked as HttpOnly. This indicates web browsers should disallow scripts from accessing the cookies. Injected malicious scripts are a common way of stealing cookies.

## [CA5397](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca5397): Do not use deprecated SslProtocols values

Older protocol versions of Transport Layer Security (TLS) are less secure than TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, and are more likely to have new vulnerabilities. Avoid older protocol versions to minimize risk.

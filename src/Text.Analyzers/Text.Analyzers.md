## [CA1714](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1714): Flags enums should have plural names

A public enumeration has the System.FlagsAttribute attribute, and its name does not end in ""s"". Types that are marked by using FlagsAttribute have names that are plural because the attribute indicates that more than one value can be specified.
